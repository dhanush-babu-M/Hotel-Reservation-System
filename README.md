# Hotel Reservation System

A **simple, modular, and intuitive Java-based application** to manage hotel reservations efficiently. This project demonstrates my understanding of **object-oriented programming, database integration, and service-based architecture** in Java.

## **Project Overview**

The Hotel Reservation System allows users to:
- View available rooms
- Book rooms for guests
- Manage hotel information
- Track reservations

It is built using **Java** with a clean **MVC-inspired architecture**:
- `model` → represents data objects like `Hotel`, `Room`, `Reservation`
- `repository` → handles data storage and retrieval
- `service` → contains business logic
- `app` → entry point to run the application

The project also uses **Maven** for dependency management.
